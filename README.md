Introduction
--

The documentation of the Open Lab Starter Kit machines is currently under development, with the goal of offering easy-to-follow instructions on how to assemble the machines. By the end of the research, each machine's documentation will be accessible online, where the user will be able to follow step-by-step instructions with an interactive 3D representation of the machine.
